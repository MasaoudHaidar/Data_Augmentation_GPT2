# Stat 98 Final Project

You can find the PDF and tex file of the presentation in the presentation folder. 

You can find the PDF of the writeup and the appendix in the writeup folder.

You can find the jupyter notebook used for this analysis in the code folder in addition to a PDF of the notebook. Note though that we couldn't upload the data files or the trained models on github because of their large sizes, but you can see their outputs from the jupyter notebook.
